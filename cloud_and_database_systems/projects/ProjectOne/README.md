DESCRIPTION: 

A wiki-like website for superheroes, including a naive login system that supports saving
  favorite heroes. The login system uses a DynamoDB table to store usernames and passwords in plain text, which I now know is horrible for security. At the time, I figured proper security was way out of scope for this project. One of the main goals was to implement CRUD operations.

TECHNOLOGIES: 

SQL database via AWS RDS, NoSQL database via AWS DynamoDB, web app hosted via Flask.
