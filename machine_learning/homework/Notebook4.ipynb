Why do you think this was the case?\n","\n","kNN consistently achieved a higher r^2 value than decision trees did. Because of this, it is easy to say that kNN performed better. Decision trees performed so poor on this dataset that both r^2 values were negative, meaning they were worse at guessing the target value of the test cases than the average was. This could indicate that, in the dataset, there is no one good value for gaining information in order to predict new values of the target. In comparison, the success of the kNN algorithm could indicate that multiple or all of the predictors are important for predicting new values of the target."]}]}
