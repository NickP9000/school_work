Which model performed the best? Why do you think this model performed the best? \\\\\n","\n","The tuned perceptron model performed among the best, along with another model. I think the perceptron model performed this well because the model was able to find a maxima, perhaps the global maxima, between all the dimensions of the dataset. The weights, tuned to this maxima, were able to highly effiecently classify the data.\n","\n","b. What effect did the principal component analysis have on the accuracy of your best model? Why do you think this is the case?\n","\n","As expected, reducing the dimensions of the dataset reduced the accuracy of my best model. This is due to the fact that reducing the dimensions of the dataset by combining dimensions increases noise and reduces the amount of data the model can learn from. That said, my best model performed very well, considering that the dimensions were reduced from about 30 to 2. "]}]}
